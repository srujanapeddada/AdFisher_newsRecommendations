User Profiling on News Websites

With an overwhelming majority of readers obtaining daily news from online sources, news agencies are seeking to recoup lost sales by optimizing the recommendations they provide to visitors of their websites. Previous information flow experiments indicate that discrimination may arise in online advertising by profiling users based on inferences about sensitive attributes, such as gender and health status. Given that news websites exhibit some of the most extensive online tracking, it is essential to investigate how these sites use browsing behavior (both internal and external to the news sites) to provide recommendations, and ensure that recommendations are provided in a fair and appropriate manner. Using AdFisher, a previously developed tool to study information flow, the current study revealed passive personalization on the New York Times webpage in response to browsing behavior within the site. The implications for personalization on a variety of news topics is discussed.
